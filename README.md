# Type-challenges by Camilo Guerrero

In this repository I share my solution to the '**Type Challenges**' this is a repository that helps us improve and better understand how types work in TypeScript through challenges.

You can find more information by visiting the repository: [Type Challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges).

## Challenges

The challenges are handled according to their difficulty and are divided into 5 categories: `warm-up`, `easy`, `medium`, `hard`, `extreme` (warm-up will only have our welcome).
Each of the challenges I solve will have the url to the original repository inside in case you want to see the statement, see other solutions or you are encouraged to solve it
